# Zuul-API-example
Zuul acts as an API gateway or Edge service. It receives all the requests coming from the UI and then delegates the requests to internal microservices. So, we have to create a brand new microservice which is Zuul-enabled, and this service sits on top of all other microservices. It acts as an Edge service or client-facing service. Its Service API should be exposed to the client/UI. The client calls this service as a proxy for an internal microservice, then this service delegates the request to the appropriate service.
